Overview of What I’ve Done
Imported Libraries


Brought in pandas for data manipulation.


Loaded the Dataset


Read the Kaggle “Medical Appointments” CSV (May 2016) into a DataFrame.


Displayed initial head(), info() to understand shape and dtypes.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Checked for duplicate rows.


Generated summary statistics (describe()) for numerical columns.


Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


Invalid Ages: Removed entries where age is negative or zero.


Column Names: Lowercased and replaced spaces/special characters with underscores.


Renaming: Standardized certain column names (e.g., no_show → no_show, if you renamed).


Handicap Encoding: Converted the handicap column to binary (0 = no handicap, 1 = any handicap).


Date Parsing: Cast appointment and scheduled dates to datetime objects for time‐series readiness.


No‑Show Encoding: Mapped “Yes”/“No” to 1/0 to facilitate modeling later.


Gender Standardization: Stripped whitespace, uppercased, and replaced M/F with Male/Female.


Neighborhood Formatting: Title‑cased neighborhood names so they’re human‑readable and consistent.


Final Checks & Export


Ran info(), describe(), and head() again to verify cleaning.


Saved the cleaned DataFrame to cleaned_medical_appointments.csv.
